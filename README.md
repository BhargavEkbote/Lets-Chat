# Lets-Chat
LetsChat is a base that can be built upon in order to create a social media platform.

If you find a bug make a Pull request that fixes the bug or file an Issue.

Current goals: Add more basic features out of the box so that it doesn't take extra time to implement those features in forks.

## Instructions to Implement:

1. Change the backend server with your own backend server.
2. This is made to be as customisable and easy to tweak as it can be, so tweak all you want.
