# Lets-Chat
LetsChat is a base that can be built upon to create a social media platform.

If you find a bug make a Pull request that fixes the bug or file an Issue.

Current goals: 
1. Make an example instance.
2. Add more basic features out of the box so that implementing those features in forks doesn't take extra time.
3. Release version 6.0 which would feature full Realtime Filters integration.

## Instructions to Implement:

1. Change the backend server with your backend server.
2. This is made as customisable and easy to tweak as possible, so tweak all you want.
